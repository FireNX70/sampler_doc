S-5XX (S-50/S-550/W-30) diskette formats.

S-550 format figured out mostly thanks to Gary J. Murakami's format defs and
partly thanks to an old e-mail by Marc Resibois found on Sgroup.

S-50 and S-7XX formats partly figured out thanks to llamamusic's online tools.


Disks are always 720KB DSDD.
Big-endian.
			
Sample data is organized in two banks. 18 segments per bank.
12288 12-bit samples per segment packed as TM BB TM. The top nibble in BB
belongs to the first sample. The bottom nibble belongs to the second one.

Audio may or may not have pre-emphasis, I'm not sure. It didn't seem to me like
it did.

Header at 0x00.
Patch data starts at 0xFC00.
Function parameters at 0x10C00.
MIDI parameters at 0x10D00.
Tone parameters start at 0x10E00.
Tone list starts at 0x11E00.
Sample bank A starts at 0x12000.
Sample bank B starts at 0x63000.

			  This one's probably padding.

		The loop point marks the start of the loop. The normal looping mode (0,
		forward) will loop by playing until the end point and jumping back to
		the loop point.

		Despite the S-50's lack of real time filters; Roland's own S-550 to S-50
		converter leaves tones untouched, including their TVF settings. So I'm
		not sure how those bytes work in the S-50 format.

	Tone list (32 entries per disk)
		0x00: Tone name. 8 chars.
		0x08: Output assign. 1 byte.

S-50
	TODO:
		Figure out patch modulation setting
		Figure out patch tone to key stuff
		Figure out value range diffs vs S-550 for function and MIDI
		parameters

	Machine names are "S-50 MT25A" and "S-51 MT25A".

	Header
		0x00: 4 0x00 bytes.
		0x04: Machine name. 10 chars.
		0x0E: Zero.
		0x0F: Varies. I've seen both 1 and 4.
		0x10: System version and copyright. 144 chars.
		0xA0: Other text. 352 bytes. There's pretty much always "310714" at
			  0x170, "560804" at 0x190 and "600502" at 0x1B0.
			
	S-50 disks can contain the OS, not just samples. The first 62KB after the
	header seem to be reserved for that.

	There's 8 patch slots per disk. Each patch is 512 bytes long. Unused slots
	are padded.

	Patch format
		0x000: Name. 12 chars.
		0x00C: Bend range. 1 byte.

		0x013: Key mode. 1 byte.
		0x014: Velocity sw threashold. 1 byte.

		0x0A1: Unknown. 19 bytes.
		0x0B4: Tone to key 2. 109 bytes.

		0x12A: Output level. 1 byte.
		0x12B: Unknown. 1 byte. Murakami's documentation calls this "dummy2".
		0x12C: Detune. 1 byte. Probably signed.
		0x12D: Velocity mix ratio. 1 byte.
		0x12E: Aftertouch assign. 1 byte.
		0x12F: Unknown. 209 bytes. Looks like padding.


S-550
	Machine names are "S550 MT25B" and "S330 MT25C".

	Almost the same as the S-50 format. However, patches are now 256 bytes and
	there's 16 slots. Patches no longer contain a modulation setting. However,
	other parameters have been added to patches.

W-30
	Machine name is "W-30    ", with the last two bytes being now no
	longer part of the machine name but rather padding.

	Header
		0x00: 4 0x00 bytes.
		0x04: Machine name. 8 chars.
		0x0C: Looks like it's pretty much always 0x06 0x00 0x00 0x01.
		0x10: Text block. 112 chars. Contains text indicating the type of disk
			  at 0x20. Otherwise, mostly filled with spaces. 0xFE at 0x1F, 0x3F,
			  0x5F and 0x7F.
		0x80: Padding, 384 bytes.

	The type of disks we're interested in seems to be "W-30 Sound & Song Data
	Disk".
			
	Based on the S-550 format (16 256B patches).

	W-30 sample disks do not contain the OS. The section formerly
	reserved for the OS is now taken up by sequence data and an extra
	tone section.

	Extra tone parameters at 0xD800.
	Extra tone list at 0xF800.

	Extra tones seem to use banks 2 and 3 (probably ROM A and ROM B), with bank
	4 being the unused value. The normal tone list uses the normal values (Bank
	A = 0, Bank B = 1, Unused = 2).

	This extra tone section is not mandatory. Out of all disk images I checked,
	it was only included in the factory library.
			
	After taking a look at the W-30's manual, it seems this section contains 64
	tones that reference wave data in the W-30's ROM and which are treated as 33
	through 96. These tones can be written and loaded like normal tones.
	However, these are useless without the W-30's ROM data.
			
	The usual 32 tones are treated normally.
