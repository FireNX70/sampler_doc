S-7XX diskette format.

Little-endian.

Known to use pre-emphasis.

Can use both 720 KB DSDD and 1440 KB DSHD disks. DD and HD formats are nearly
identical, with the DD format holding a bit under half the samples per disk as
its HD counterpart (304128 vs 672768, 16-bit samples). Saving to DD disks
requires twice as many disks (potentially 2 times plus 1).

In multi-disk volumes, parameter data is always loaded from the first disk.
Inconsistencies in parameter data are ignored. Mismatches in the disk ID will
cause the sampler to keep requesting the next disk upon inserting it. After
enough time has passed, inserting a disk with a mismatch will cause the loading
process to error out.

"Patch stereo mix" and "Partial stereo mix" were removed from the S-760, so I
will not be able to document them.
"Patch output assign", "Partial output assign" and "Sample pan" had their range
extended on the S-760. The value ranges documented here will be valid for the
S-760 but I'm unsure what the S-770's/S-750's behavior would be.

"Aftertouch LFO pan depth", "Modulation LFO pan depth" and "Control change LFO
pan depth" were patch parameters added with the SP-700 and not present on the
S-760.
"LFO pan modulation depth" was a partial parameter added with the SP-700, not
present on the S-760 V1 and added back in V2.

The diskette format, both DD and HD, has slots for 1 volume, 64 performances,
128 patches, 256 partials and 512 samples.

The S-770's manual's figures for the sampler's memory match these, except for
the partial count where it claims to have 255 slots instead of 256. This
discrepancy may be due to 0xFF being used as a dummy value.

Audio data at 0x1F800.

All lists are made up of 16-char entries holding the names of performances,
patches, etc. The volume name is also 16 chars long.

The audio section is divided into 66 (DSDD) or 146 (DSHD) segments per disk,
each one 4608 samples (9216 bytes) in length.
Because writing to a diskette will always rewrite the entire diskette, no
individual samples will be deleted or overwritten; so there's no space for
fragmentation and no need for a FAT.

The S-760 shifts the audio 5 segments down. This happens on both DD and HD
diskettes. The reason for this is that the S-760 stores extra performance
parameters at 0x1F800. Why the audio data would be shifted by a whole 5 segments
when the extra performance data is relatively small (it takes up 512 bytes; most
likely because of the block size, given that the actual data takes up much less
space) is beyond me.


Header (96 B)
	0x00: Padding, 4 bytes.
	0x04: Machine name, 10 chars.
	0x0E: Padding, 1 byte.
	0x0F: Media type, 1 byte enum.
	0x10: Text, 80 chars. Sys. ver, copyright, etc.
	
	Machine name is always "S770 MR25A". However, the machine name in "Text"
	changes from "SYS-772" on most S-7XX machines to "S-760" on the S-760.
	
	"Text" can also be used to tell diskettes and HDDs apart. Diskettes should
	contain "SYS-772 Sound Disk" or "S-760 Sound Disk" (usually followed by a
	space, not a null char) at 0x11 from the start of text.


Media type
	HDD, //also used for CDs
	HDD_with_OS = 0x20,
	DSDD_SYS_770 = 0x31,
	DSHD_diskette,
	DSDD_diskette,
	HDD_with_OS_S760 = 0x40,
	DSHD_SYS_760 = 0x50


Element counts/TOC (16 B)
	0x00: Disk index, 8-bit uint. Only relevant for multi-disk volumes.
	0x01: Disk count, 8-bit uint. 0 means one disk, the true count is this +1.
	0x02: ID, 32-bit uint. All 0s on the library diskettes.
	0x06: Volume count, 16-bit uint.
	0x08: Performance count, 16-bit uint.
	0x0A: Patch count, 16-bit uint.
	0x0C: Partial count, 16-bit uint.
	0x0E: Sample count, 16-bit uint.
	
	I'm not entirely sure that 0x2 is an ID. The first byte increments by one
	every time I save to disk. The second byte for now remains at 0, I suspect
	it might be the upper byte of a 16-bit value. The last two bytes vary fairly
	wildly every time.


Performance (256 B)
	0x00: Name. 16 chars.
	0x10: Part patch map. 32 bytes (one per part). 0-based, 0xFF marks
		  unassigned parts. This is an index, it does NOT match a patch's "Patch
		  number".
	0x30: Part channel map. 16 bytes. Each byte contains the channel number
		  (0-based) for 2 parts, where the bottom nibble of the first byte is
		  the channel number for part one and the upper nibble is the channel
		  number for part 2 and so on.
	0x40: Part volume and enable flag. 32 bytes (one per part). Each byte
		  contains the part's volume (0 - 127, the lower 7 bits) and its enable
		  flag (top bit).
	0x60: Part low note. 32 8-bit uints.
	0x80: Part high note. 32 8-bit uints.
	0xA0: Part low fade width. 32 8-bit uints.
	0xC0: Part high fade width. 32 8-bit uints.
	0xE0: Program change filter. 16-bit bitfield. One bit per channel.
	0xE2: Pitch bend filter. 16-bit bitfield. One bit per channel.
	0xE4: Modulation filter. 16-bit bitfield. One bit per channel.
	0xE6: Hold filter. 16-bit bitfield. One bit per channel.
	0xE8: Phase lock. 16-bit bitfield. One bit per channel.
	0xEA: Volume filter. 16-bit bitfield. One bit per channel.
	0xEC: Aftertouch filter. 16-bit bitfield. One bit per channel.
	0xEE: Aftertouch filter 2. 16-bit bitfield. One bit per channel.
	0xF0: Velocity curve type. 16-bytes, one per channel. Values are 0
		  (disabled) through 7. This is pretty wasteful.
	
	The aftertouch filter works in an even stranger way than the pan filter (see
	extra performance parameters). When a bit is low in the first bitfield and
	high in the second one, the corresponding channel will ignore aftertouch
	data. When the first bitfield's bit is high and the second bitfield's bit is
	low, the channel will be considered to be in "channel aftertouch" mode (C).
	When both bits are equal, regardless of whether they are high or low (the
	S-760 sets them both high), the channel is set into "polyphonic aftertouch"
	mode (P).


Extra performance parameters (100 B)
	0x00: Output high gain. 8 8-bit ints, one per output.
	0x08: Output high frequency. 8 8-bit ints, one per output. Centered around
		  6 KHz (0); with negative and positive values representing frequencies
		  below or above that, respectively.
	0x10: Output low gain. 8 8-bit ints, one per output.
	0x18: Output low frequency. 8 8-bit ints, one per output. Centered around
		  160 Hz (0); with negative and positive values representing frequencies
		  below or above that, respectively.
	0x20: Part output map. 32 8-bit uints, one per part.
	0x40: Part pan. 32 8-bit ints, one per part.
	0x60: Pan filter. 16-bit bitfield.
	0x62: Pan filter 2. 16-bit bitfield.
	0x64: Unused? 28 bytes.
	0x80: Mirrors performance data starting at 0x80 (part high note).
	
	The gain and frequency parameters are for per-output EQ.
	
	The part output map uses 0 - 3 for A - D, 4 - 11 for 1 - 8 and 0xFF for
	patch-controlled.
	
	The pan filter works in a strange way. If the corresponding bit on both
	bitfields is low, the channel will ignore MIDI pan instructions. If its
	corresponding bit is high only on the first bitfield, it will be set into
	"continuous pan" mode (marked with a C). If the second bitfield's
	corresponding bit is high (regardless of the first bitfield's state), the
	channel will be marked with a "D" (which I assume stands for "delayed pan").
	
	On the original S-760 OS, the pan filter was a simple switch. On would act
	the same way as "D". With revision 2 of the OS, continuous pan was
	introduced. Adding a second bitfield was the easiest way to tack on the
	extra MIDI filter state without affecting compatibility. However,
	considering that the second bitfield is prioritized, inconsistent behavior
	may manifest across OS revisions; as I assume that only the first bitfield
	existed in version 1 of the OS, and so only it would be considered. Thus; a
	channel with its bit unset on the first bitfield and set on the second one
	would be considered to be using "D" panning on version 2 of the OS, but
	would be considered to have panning disabled on version 1. This has no
	effect in practice because both bits are unset when disabling pan through
	the S-760's interface. The only way to cause this would be to edit the MIDI
	filter data with external tools.

	Control select seems to default to 2 (breath control). Range 0 - 95, with
	the values corresponding to standard MIDI CCs.
	
	The S-760 does not appear to care about mismatched values for the three
	output variables. It looks like it always uses "Output (absolute)".
	
	Aftertouch to LFO to pan, modulation to LFO to pan, control to LFO to pan
	and oneshot were added with V2 of the S-760 OS.

	With regard to outputs; partials once again use three variables, much in the
	same way as patches, to keep track of which output should be used. Again, it
	appears the absolute value is the one that's always actually used to
	determine the sampler's behavior.
	
	0x63 would probably be the TVA envelope's release level, but it's not
	editable on hardware (always forced to 0). Might wanna check what happens if
	I manually modify this byte on a hex editor.
	
	TVF and TVA velocity curve values 0 - 3 directly correspond to curves 1 - 4.

The sample parameter section is made up of several segments of 10 samples'
parameters and 32 bytes of padding. Whenever a segment would be used only
partially, the remaining slots get padded with data from the previous segment.
It's fairly easy to tell this dummy data apart because every 4th byte in the
data section is either 0x7C or 0x7D, which will show up as '|' and '}'.

	On some CDs, I've encountered samples where the bottom bit of the top nibble
	(0x10) of the sample rate was 1. After editing one of my diskette images and
	loading it, it seems this has no effect. After saving to that same diskette
	and reading it, it turns out the top nibble was reset to 0 by the sampler.
	
	The format uses mono samples exclusively. It creates stereo pairs by using
	two samples with 0x7F 'L' or 0x7F 'R' (which the S-7XX machines display as
	"=L" and "=R", respectively) as the last two characters of a sample's name.
	The rest of the name is identical.
	Partials point to both samples in stereo pairs. The ones I checked used pan
	values of -32 (L) and +32 (R).
	
	It seems even Roland's official library contains samples that try to read
	past the end of the disk. I don't know if it's meant to read from the next
	disk in a multi-disk volume.
