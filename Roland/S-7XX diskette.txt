S-7XX diskette format.

Can use both 720KB DSDD and 1.44MB DSHD disks.

Little-endian.

Known to use pre-emphasis.

Machine name is "S770 MR25A".

I have partially figured out the DSHD format. I do not have any disk images for
the DSDD one. I assume it's the same but cut down. I have yet to figure out the
individual data structures (performances, patches, etc.).

A DSHD disk has slots for 1 volume, 64 performances, 128 patches, 256 partials
and 512 samples.

The S-770's manual's figures for the sampler's own memory match these, except
for the partial count where it claims to have 255 slots instead of 256. This
discrepancy may be a mistake in Roland's own manual.

Header
	0x00: Padding, 4 bytes.
	0x04: Machine name, 10 chars.
	0x0E: Padding, 2 bytes.
	0x10: Text, 80 chars. Sys. ver, copyright, etc.

Element counts
	0x00: Unknown, 6 bytes.
	0x06: Volume count, uint16.
	0x08: Performance count, uint16.
	0x0A: Patch count, uint16.
	0x0C: Partial count, uint16.
	0x0E: Sample count, uint16.

All lists are made up of 16-char entries holding the names of volumes,
performances, patches, etc.


Performance (256B)
	0x00: Name, 16 chars.
	0x10: Probably the patch map. 16 1-byte entries, with each entry as a
		  patch's index and each slot corresponding to a MIDI channel. 0xFF
		  seems to be used to indicate a channel is unused.
	0x20: Unknown, 64 bytes.
	0x60: Either low note or low fade settings. 16 1-byte slots, 1 per
		  part/channel. Default value seems to be 0x15 (21).
	0x70: Either low note or low fade settings. 16 1-byte slots, 1 per
		  part/channel. Default value seems to be 0x15 (21).
	0x80: Either high note or high fade settings. 16 1-byte slots, 1 per
		  part/channel. Default value seems to be 0x6C (108).
	0x90: Either high note or high fade settings. 16 1-byte slots, 1 per
		  part/channel. Default value seems to be 0x6C (108).
	0xA0: Unknown, 96 bytes.


Patch (256B)
	0x00: Name, 16 chars.
	0x10: Patch index, 8-bit uint.
	0x11: Unknown, 15 bytes.
	0x20: Partial map, 88 1-byte slots. Each slot contains a partial's index. It
		  looks like 0xFF might be used as padding, meaning the manual would be
		  correct (255 valid partials plus one dummy value).
	0x78: Unknown, 136 bytes.


Partial (128B)
	0x00: Name, 16 chars.
	0x10: Sample entries. 4 * 16 bytes.
	0x50: Unknown, 48 bytes.


Partial sample entry (16B)
	0x00: Sample index, 16-bit uint. 0xFF as dummy value.
	0x02: Unknown, 14 bytes.


Sample parameters (48B)
	0x00: Name, 16 chars.
	0x10: Unknown, 32 bytes.

	I have been unable to make any headway into the sample parameters. I think
	0x2D might hold the sample's root note, but I'm not sure. I don't really
	know how it marks where its audio data starts and ends, it doesn't really
	seem straightforward. It might be using some sort of "segment" system like
	on the S-5XX.

The sample parameter section seems to be made up of several segments of 10
samples' parameters and 32 bytes of padding. Whenever a segment would be used
only partially, the remaining slots get padded with data from the previous
segment. It's fairly easy to tell this dummy data apart because every 4th byte
in the data section is either 0x7C or 0x7D, which will show up as '|' and '}'.

The audio section on DSHD disks holds 672768 16-bit samples (1314KB).
