S-7XX HDDs and CDs. L-CD7XX, L-CDC, L-CDP and L-CDX libraries.

Little-endian.

Known to use pre-emphasis.

Bizarrely; while the older S-550 had a proper (if basic) file system, the S-7XX
series seems to rely on a fairly rigid format.

The S-770's manual claims a maximum capacity of 128 volumes, 512 performances,
1024 patches, 4096 partials and 8192 samples per HDD. This lines up with the
spacing for the different sections on the disk images I've checked.
The maximum size of an S-7XX FS is 0x2429A800 (606709760) bytes, or 592490 KB
The maximum capacity for audio is 65524 segments (603869184 B).

Differences between the normal S-7XX HDD format and the S-760's are as follows:
	1. "S-760 System Disk" as opposed to "SYS-772 HardDisk Sys" at 0x11 within
	   the header's text. The version string still starts at 0x26 (from the
	   start of the text).
	
	2. The audio section starts later. This was done to accommodate extra OS
	   data. Technically, 0x2B5800 is still treated as the start of the audio
	   section but audio data is written starting at segment 0x72 (treated as
	   0x74 by the FAT).
	
	3. The OS sections are padded with 0xFF (as opposed to 0xCF23) when the HDD
	   does not contain an OS.
	
	4. Performances may contain the extra performance data in the unused part of
	   the 16-bit index block.
	   
	5. The S-760 can write sound data to normal S-7XX HDDs, but not its OS.

Header (96 B)
	0x00: Padding, 4 bytes.
	0x04: Machine name, 10 chars.
	0x0E: Padding, 1 byte.
	0x0F: Media type, 1 byte enum.
	0x10: Text, 80 chars. Sys. ver, copyright, etc.
	
	Machine name is always "S770 MR25A".
	
	The text appears to be the only reliable way to tell whether an HDD without
	an OS was formatted by an S-760 or a more normal S-7XX machine. Text from a
	normal S-7XX machine will contain "SYS-772" at 0x11 (from the start of the
	text). An S-760 will write "S-760" there. The only real incompatibility
	between both variants is the OS, which is why the S-760 uses a different
	media type value for its HDDs with an OS to begin with.


Media type
	HDD,
	HDD_with_OS = 0x20,
	DSHD_diskette = 0x32,
	DSDD_diskette,
	HDD_with_OS_S760 = 0x40
	
	The media types used by CDs are identical to those used by HDDs. Other
	media, like SyQuest or Zip disks, probably also use it. The manual makes it
	sound like tape is only used for backups, but I haven't done any testing
	with tapes.


TOC (32 B)
	0x00: Disk name, 16 chars.
	0x10: Block count, 24-bit uint. 512 B blocks.
	0x13: Unsure, 1 byte. Likely the top byte to the block count, but always
		  unused.
	0x14: Volume count, 16-bit uint.
	0x16: Performance count, 16-bit uint.
	0x18: Patch count, 16-bit uint.
	0x1A: Partial count, 16-bit uint.
	0x1C: Sample count, 16-bit uint.
	0x1E: Padding, 2 bytes.
	
	The variable I believe to be the block count is 0x3E000 on LCDP-05 and
	0x1214D4 on a 2 GB CF after formatting.
	
	LCDP-05's size would be exactly 0x7C00000; and it is true that, starting at
	that address, it's all 0s. However, LCDP-05's audio section seems to
	actually end at 0x78B83FF and I've confirmed it only has 13427 segments.
	This means it actually is only 0x3C5C2 blocks in size.
	On the other hand, the CF's total usable space (tested by filling it up with
	an S-760 until it reported no space left) perfectly coincided with "Block
	count" (assuming 512 B blocks).
	
	Modifying the block count on the CF did not affect the available time
	displayed by the sampler, which is actually directly controlled by a
	variable in the FAT. Reinitializing the CF only resulted in the block count
	being set back to 0x1214D4.


The OS is stored at 0x800 through 0x807FF. On the S-760; more OS data is stored
starting at 0x2B5800, where the audio data would usually start, and ending at
0x3317FF. Loading volumes into memory and then writing the OS to disk affects
the saved OS.


FAT
	0x00000: FAT, 16-bit uint entries. Max 65526 entries.
	0x1FFEC: Unused, 20 bytes. Most are 0xFF, some are 0xFE.
	
	Like in most FAT filesystems, the first two slots are not usable and hold
	special values.
	Slot 0 is always 0xFFFA.
	Slot 1 tracks the number of remaining free segments.
	
	The FAT works with audio segments instead of clusters. Audio segment
	indices always have an offset of +2 (the beginning of audio data would be
	treated as segment 2). The maximum index value for data is 0xFFF5. 0
	indicates a free segment. 0xFFF8 is the end-of-chain marker. The S-760 marks
	the segments taken up by the OS (the first 114 segments) with 0xFFFE (first
	half) and 0xFFFD (second half).
	
	Modifying the free segment count does directly affect the displayed
	remaining time. Even if the block count doesn't match, recalculating the
	available time did not alter the free segment count (nor the displayed
	time).


List entry (32 B)
	0x00: Name, 16 chars.
	0x10: Element type, 1 byte enum.
	0x11: Unknown, 1 byte. Usually 0.
	0x12: Next index, 16-bit uint. +0x8000 offset. 0xFFFF if last entry.
	0x14: Previous index, 16-bit uint. +0x8000 offset. 0xFFFF if first entry.
	0x16: Current index, 16-bit uint. No offset.
	0x18: Unknown, 3 bytes. Seems to always be 0.
	0x1B: Program number, 8-bit uint. Only used by volumes. Range 64 to 127
		  (displayed as 65 to 128), with 0 (library CDs) and 0x3F (S-760)
		  displyed as disabled. Performances appear to use this for something
		  too, but there doesn't seem to be a way to edit it from the sampler.
	0x1C: Start segment, 16-bit uint. Only used by samples.
	0x1F: Segment count, 16-bit uint. Used by pretty much everything.
	
	I'm not sure why the element type variable exists. It's not like you could
	have lists with entries of different types, so it's completely redundant.
	Perhaps they intended to make a proper filesystem originally? To be fair, it
	is useful in determining whether a given slot is in use.
	
	On the LCDP libraries, what I have called indices behave in a sane way. In
	the first entry, next index would be 0x8001, prev index would be 0xFFFF and
	current index would be 0. Then, in the second entry; next index would be
	0x8002, prev index would be 0x8000 and current index would be 1. If I
	deleted an entry, the previous entry would correctly point to the next one
	and vice-versa.
	However, when I tested with the CF these indices were all over the place.
	For example, the first two entries would list 0x8000 as the previous index.
	Appending a volume (via a copy) would result in the second-to-last entry
	listing 0xFFFF as the next index and the newly added performance listing
	both the next and previous indices as 0xFFFF.
	These being all set to 0 did not appear to lead to any problems even on
	large lists containing deleted/free slots.

Volume (256 B)
	0x00: Name, 16 chars.
	0x10: Padding, 16 bytes. Always 0.
	0x20: 16-bit absolute indices to performances. 112 entries. Unused entries
		  padded with 0xFFFF.


Performance (512 B)
	0x000: Normal performance data, 256 bytes. See diskette format.
	0x100: 16-bit absolute indices to patches, 32 entries (64 bytes). Unused
		   entries marked with 0xFFFF.
	0x140: Padding, 64 bytes. 0xFF.
	0x17F: Extra performance parameters flag, 1 byte. 0 if extra performance
		   parameters present. 0xFF otherwise.
	0x180: Normal S-760 extra performance parameters, 100 bytes. S-760 only,
		   padded with 0xFF otherwise. See diskette format.
	0x1E4: Padding, 28 bytes. 0xFF.


Patch (512 B)
	0x000: Normal patch data, 256 bytes. See diskette format.
	0x100: 16-bit absolute indices to partials. 128 entries. Unused entries
		   padded with 0xFFFF. The first 88 indices are mapped to the "key
		   partial map". The "key partial map" usually contains copies of these
		   indices' lower bytes.


It's strange that they chose to keep the data structures identical to the
diskette format's and to just append an entire half block's worth of data for
the 16-bit indices.

Partials and samples are identical to the diskette format's.
Partials already use 16-bit indices in the diskette format.
Samples already used 16-bit segment counts. As for their start segments, "start
segment" and "disk index" are both 0 on all samples on the disks I've checked.
It would appear that the start segment from the list is used instead. It's
likely that the segment count from the list is also used instead of the sample's
own.


Deleting a volume, performance, etc. will overwrite its list entry with 0s and
its parameters entry with 0xFF. The FAT will see any segments corresponding to
deleted samples marked with 0, just like normal free segments.
Care must be taken when loading a list to account for empty slots within it (for
example, the TOC listing 88 samples doesn't mean they'll occupy slots 0 - 87).
Checking whether the element type of a given entry is 0 seems reasonable. Worth
noting is that, when deleting a single entry (or only a few), the first byte of
the name will not be set to 0 but to 0xFE on the deleted entries.

Lower level elements can be deleted even if in use by higher level elements
(i.e. a sample can be deleted even if used by a partial, a partial can be
deleted even if used by a patch, etc.). Loading three partials, one that uses a
deleted sample (now an empty sample slot), one that uses a sample before it and
one using a sample after it, will see the corresponding sample entry disabled
in the partial that referenced the deleted sample while the other two partials
will still use the correct samples. Looking through the sample menu, no free
slots are left in memory. Despite the disk load menu displaying a contiguous
list without free slots, saving a sample inserts it into the free slot.
Returning to the load menu will display it where the free slot would have been.
Loading the three partials again, the one that referenced the empty slot will
now load and use the newly saved sample while the other two still use their
corresponding samples. This behavior appears unaffected by list indices ("List
entry" 0x12, 0x14 and 0x16). I tested both with unmodified and zeroed indices.
When inserting the sample into the list with zeroed indices, next index and prev
index both were 0xFFFF and current index was 0.
