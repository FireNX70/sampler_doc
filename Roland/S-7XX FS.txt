S-7XX HDDs and CDs. L-CD7XX, L-CDC, L-CDP and L-CDX libraries.

Bizarrely; while the older S-550 had a proper (if basic) file system, the S-7XX
series seems to rely on a fairly rigid format.

The S-770's manual claims a maximum capacity of 128 volumes, 512 performances,
1024 patches, 4096 partials and 8192 samples per HDD. This lines up with the
spacing for the different sections on the disk images I've checked.
The maximum size of an S-7XX FS is 0x2429A800 (606709760) bytes, or 592490 KB
The maximum capacity for audio is 65524 segments (603869184 B).

Differences between the normal S-7XX HDD format and the S-760's are as follows:
	1. "S-760 System Disk" as opposed to "SYS-772 HardDisk Sys" at 0x11 within
	   the header's text. The version string still starts at 0x26 (within the
	   text block).
	
	2. The audio section starts later. This was done to accommodate extra OS
	   data. Technically, 0x2B5800 is still treated as the start of the audio
	   section but audio data is written starting at segment 0x72 (treated as
	   0x74).
	
	3. The OS sections are padded with 0xFF (as opposed to 0xCF23) when the HDD
	   does not contain an OS.
	
	4. Performances may contain the extra performance data in the unused part of
	   the 16-bit index block.
	   
	5. The S-760 can write sound data to normal S-7XX HDDs, but not its OS.

Header (96 B)
	0x00: Padding, 4 bytes.
	0x04: Machine name, 10 chars.
	0x0E: Padding, 1 byte.
	0x0F: Media type, 1 byte enum.
	0x10: Text, 80 chars. Sys. ver, copyright, etc.
	
	Machine name is always "S770 MR25A".
	
	The text appears to be the only reliable way to tell whether an HDD without
	an OS was formatted by an S-760 or a more normal S-7XX machine. Text from a
	normal S-7XX machine will contain "SYS-772" at 0x11 (from the start of the
	text). An S-760 will write "S-760" there. The only real incompatibility
	between both variants is the OS, which is why the S-760 uses a different
	media type value for its HDDs with an OS to begin with.


Media type
	HDD,
	HDD_with_OS = 0x20,
	DSHD_diskette = 0x32,
	DSDD_diskette,
	HDD_with_OS_S760 = 0x40
	
	The media types used by CDs are identical to those used by HDDs. Other
	media, like SyQuest or Zip disks, probably also use it. The manual makes it
	sound like tape is only used for backups, but I haven't done any testing
	with tapes.


TOC (32 B)
	0x00: Disk name, 16 chars.
	0x10: Block count, 24-bit uint. 512 B blocks.
	0x13: Unsure, 1 byte. Likely the top byte to the block count, but always
		  unused.
	0x14: Volume count, 16-bit uint.
	0x16: Performance count, 16-bit uint.
	0x18: Patch count, 16-bit uint.
	0x1A: Partial count, 16-bit uint.
	0x1C: Sample count, 16-bit uint.
	0x1E: Padding, 2 bytes.
	
	The variable I believe to be the block count is 0x3E000 on LCDP-05 and
	0x1214D4 on a 2 GB CF after formatting.
	
	LCDP-05's size would be exactly 0x7C00000; and it is true that, starting at
	that address, it's all 0s. However, LCDP-05's audio section seems to
	actually end at 0x78B83FF and I've confirmed it only has 13427 segments.
	This means it actually is only 0x3C5C2 blocks in size.
	On the other hand, the CF's total usable space (tested by filling it up with
	an S-760 until it reported no space left) perfectly coincided with "Block
	count" (assuming 512 B blocks).
	
	Modifying the block count on the CF did not affect the available time
	displayed by the sampler, which is actually directly controlled by a
	variable in the FAT. Reinitializing the CF only resulted in the block count
	being set back to 0x1214D4.


The OS is stored at 0x800 through 0x807FF. On the S-760; more OS data is stored
starting at 0x2B5800, where the audio data would usually start, and ending at
0x3317FF. Loading volumes into memory and then writing the OS to disk affects
the saved OS.


FAT
	0x00000: 0xFFFA always, regardless of the size of the media.
	0x00002: Remaining free segment count, 16-bit uint.
	0x00004: FAT, 16-bit uint entries. Max 65524 entries.
	0x1FFEC: Unused, 20 bytes. Most are 0xFF, some are 0xFE.
	
	The FAT works with audio segments instead of blocks. Audio segment addresses
	always have an offset of +2 (the beginning of audio data would be treated as
	segment 2). 0 indicates a free block. 0xFFF8 is the end-of-chain marker. The
	S-760 marks the segments taken up by the OS (the first 114 segments) with
	0xFFFE (first half) and 0xFFFD (second half).
	
	If we were to interpret the FAT as starting at 0x80800; the first two
	entries would be taken up by 0xFFFA and the remaining free segment count,
	respectively. This explains the offset of +2, at least in part.
	
	Modifying the free segment count does directly affect the displayed
	remaining time. Recalculating the available time does not alter the free
	segment count (nor the displayed time), regardless of whether it matches the
	block count in any way.
	
	The free segment count apparently can be recalculated from the Disk Optimize
	menu. Doing so on the CF with the modified "Block count" had no effect.


List entry (32 B)
	0x00: Name, 16 chars.
	0x10: Element type, 1 byte enum.
	0x11: Unknown, 1 byte. Usually 0.
	0x12: Unknown, 6 bytes. Contains a sequence of values like
		  N+2 0x8X N 0x8X N+1 Y (ex. 0x02 0x80 0x00 0x80 0x01 0X00). The
		  sequence's N value grows by 1 with each entry. 0x8X and Y increase
		  like so 0xFF 0x80 0xFD 0x80 0xFE 0x00, 0x00 0x81 0xFE 0x80 0xFF 0x01,
		  0x02 0x81 0x00 0x81 0x01 0x01.
		  The first entry in a list has 0x01 0x80 0xFF 0xFF 0x00 0x00 instead.
		  The last entry in a list has the sequence 0xFF 0xFF N 0x8X N+1 Y.
		  I don't know if it's some sort of convoluted index system or what it's
		  really supposed to do.
	0x18: Unknown, 3 bytes. Seems to always be 0.
	0x1B: Program number, 8-bit uint. Only used by volumes. Range 64 to 127
		  (displayed as 65 to 128), with 0 (library CDs) and 0x3F (S-760)
		  displyed as disabled.
	0x1C: Start segment, 16-bit uint. Only used by samples.
	0x1F: Segment count, 16-bit uint. Used by pretty much everything.
	
	I'm not sure why the element type variable exists. It's not like you could
	have lists with entries of different types, so it's completely redundant.
	Perhaps they intended to make a proper filesystem originally?
	
	When I tested with the CF, the values at 0x12 didn't even behave in the same
	way. I have even less of an idea what those are supposed to be now.


Element types

Volume (256 B)
	0x00: Name, 16 chars.
	0x10: Padding, 16 bytes. Always 0.
	0x20: 16-bit absolute indices to performances. 112 entries. Unused entries
		  padded with 0xFFFF.


Performance (512 B)
	0x000: Normal performance data, 256 bytes. See diskette format.
	0x100: 16-bit absolute indices to patches, 32 entries (64 bytes). Unused
		   entries marked with 0xFFFF.
	0x140: Padding, 64 bytes. 0xFF.
	0x17F: Extra performance parameters flag, 1 byte. 0 if extra performance
		   parameters present. 0xFF otherwise.
	0x180: Normal S-760 extra performance parameters, 100 bytes. S-760 only,
		   padded with 0xFF otherwise. See diskette format.
	0x1E4: Padding, 28 bytes. 0xFF.


Patch (512 B)
	0x000: Normal patch data, 256 bytes. See diskette format.
	0x100: 16-bit absolute indices to partials. 128 entries. Unused entries
		   padded with 0xFFFF. The first 88 indices are mapped to the "key
		   partial map". The "key partial map" usually contains copies of these
		   indices' lower bytes.


It's strange that they chose to keep the data structures identical to the
diskette format's and to just append an entire half block's worth of data for
the 16-bit indices.

Partials and samples are identical to the diskette format's.
Partials already use 16-bit indices in the diskette format.
Samples have a seemingly unused byte right after their segment count which I
suspect to be the upper byte for that value. As for samples' start segments,
"start segment" and "disk index" are both 0 on all samples on the disks I've
checked. It would appear that the start segment from the list is used instead.
It's likely that the segment count from the list is also used instead of the
sample's own, although the segment count was already 16-bit.
