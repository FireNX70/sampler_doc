S-7XX HDDs and CDs. L-CD7XX, L-CDC, L-CDP and L-CDX libraries.

Bizarrely; while the older S-550 had a proper (if basic) file system, the S-7XX
series seems to rely on a fairly rigid format.

The S-770's manual claims a maximum capacity of 128 volumes, 512 performances,
1024 patches, 4096 partials and 8192 samples per HDD. This lines up with the
spacing for the different sections on the disk images I've checked.
			
Header at 0x00.
TOC at 0x100.
Volume list at 0xA0800.
Performance list at 0xA1800.
Patch list at 0xA5800.
Partial list at 0xAD800.
Sample list at 0xCD800.
Volume parameters at 0x10D800.
Performance parameters at 0x115800.
Patch parameters at 0x155800.
Partial parameters at 0x1D5800.
Sample parameters at 0x255800.
Audio data starts at 0x2B5800.


The header is the same as in the floppy format.

Header
	0x00: Padding, 4 bytes.
	0x04: Machine name, 10 chars.
	0x0E: Padding, 2 bytes.
	0x10: Text, 80 chars. Sys. ver, copyright, etc.

	The text can be used to tell diskettes and HDDs apart. Diskettes should
	contain "HardDisk" (usually followed by a space, not a null char) at 0x29.


TOC
	0x00: Disk name, 16 chars.
	0x10: Unknown, 4 bytes.
	0x14: Volume count, uint16.
	0x16: Performance count, uint16.
	0x18: Patch count, uint16.
	0x1A: Partial count, uint16.
	0x1C: Sample count, uint16.
	0x1E: Padding, 2 bytes.


All disks seem to be padded with 0xFF from 0x11E to 0x3FF, but P05 has
00 08 D1 E6 00 00 02 00 00 00 at 0x200.

Most disks seem to be padded with 0xCF23 from 0x400 to 0x7FF, but P05 is padded
until 0x807FF. Actual patch data seems to start at 0xA1800 for P05.

For most discs, data seems to start at 0x800. I'm not sure what its contents
are. It's divided into blocks separated by several zeroed out bytes.

Another section starts at (0x49470, P06) (0x493C0, P08). This section seems to
contain some strings.


List entry
	0x00: Name, 16 chars.
	0x10: Element type, 1 byte.
	0x11: Unknown, 1 byte. Usually 0.
	0x12: Unknown, 6 bytes. Contains a sequence of values like
		  N+2 0x8X N 0x8X N+1 Y (ex. 0x02 0x80 0x00 0x80 0x01 0X00). The
		  sequence's N value grows by 1 with each entry. 0x8X and Y increase
		  like so 0xFF 0x80 0xFD 0x80 0xFE 0x00, 0x00 0x81 0xFE 0x80 0xFF 0x01,
		  0x02 0x81 0x00 0x81 0x01 0x01.
		  The first entry in a list has 0x01 0x80 0xFF 0xFF 0x00 0x00 instead.
		  The last entry in a list has the sequence 0xFF 0xFF N 0x8X N+1 Y.
		  I don't know if it's some sort of convoluted index system or what it's
		  really supposed to do.
	0x18: Unknown, 3 bytes. Seems to always be 0.
	0x1B: Unknown, 1 byte. Seems to be used by performances. Related to bank
		  select?
	0x1C: Start segment, 16-bit uint. Only used by samples.
	0x1F: Segment count, 16-bit uint. Used by pretty much everything.

	Element types
		volume = 0x40,
    	performance,
    	patch,
    	partial,
    	sample

Volume (256B)
	0x00: Name, 16 chars.
	0x10: Unknown, 16 bytes. Seems to always be 0.
	0x20: Seems to hold 16-bit indices for performances. There's space for 112
		  entries.


Performances and patches seem to be identical to the diskette format with an
extra 256B section appended. This section seems to contain 16-bit indices, which
I assume refer to patches and partials respectively. This makes sense as the
patch and partial maps from performances and patches only use 8-bit indices,
which would not be enough for the capacity of the HDD/CD format.

The maps do not seem to use indices respective to these. These indices are
sometimes identical to the map's. I'm not sure exactly how they're meant to work
together.


Partials and samples seem to be identical to the diskette format. Specifically
for samples, I suppose the segment indices and counts from the sample list
override the values held by the sample parameters (at least for loading).
