S-7XX HDDs and CDs. L-CD7XX, L-CDC, L-CDP and L-CDX libraries.

Bizarrely; while the older S-550 had a proper (if basic) file system, the S-7XX
series seems to rely on a fairly rigid format.

The S-770's manual claims a maximum capacity of 128 volumes, 512 performances,
1024 patches, 4096 partials and 8192 samples per HDD. This lines up with the
spacing for the different sections on the disk images I've checked.
			
Header at 0x00.
TOC at 0x100.
Volume list at 0xA0800.
Performance list at 0xA1800.
Patch list at 0xA5800.
Partial list at 0xAD800.
Sample list at 0xCD800.
Volume parameters at 0x10D800.
Performance parameters at 0x115800.
Patch parameters at 0x155800.
Partial parameters at 0x1D5800.
Sample parameters at 0x255800.
Audio data starts at 0x2B5800.

The header is the same as in the floppy format.

TOC
	0x00: Disk name, 16 chars.
	0x10: Unknown, 4 bytes.
	0x14: Volume count, uint16.
	0x16: Performance count, uint16.
	0x18: Patch count, uint16.
	0x1A: Partial count, uint16.
	0x1C: Sample count, uint16.
	0x1E: Padding, 2 bytes.

All disks seem to be padded with 0xFF from 0x11E to 0x3FF, but P05 has
00 08 D1 E6 00 00 02 00 00 00 at 0x200.

Most disks seem to be padded with 0xCF23 from 0x400 to 0x7FF, but P05 is padded
until 0x807FF. Actual patch data seems to start at 0xA1800 for P05.

For most discs, data seems to start at 0x800. I'm not sure what its contents
are. It's divided into blocks separated by several zeroed out bytes.

Another section starts at (0x49470, P06) (0x493C0, P08). This section seems to
contain some strings.
