S-550/W-30 HDDs and CDs. L-CD1 library. Can only be loaded by the S-550, W-30
and S-7XX.

512-byte blocks.
Big-endian.

Contains S-550 diskette images, minus the header and OS. The manual calls these
"areas".

These "images" contain more sample data than regular diskette images, 864KB
instead of the usual 648KB.
As it turns out, it's the original 12-bit sample data; which has been converted
into 16-bit little-endian signed PCM audio.

HDD header
	0x00: Magic, 16 chars. "* ROLAND S-550 *".
	0x10: Padding. Either 0xFFs or zeroes.

CD header
	Same as the HDD header plus
	0x20: Text, 224 chars.


After the header (0x20 for HDD, 0x100 for CD) starts the directory list.

HDD directory
	0x00: Name, 16 chars.
	0x10: Block address, uint32.
	0x14: Block count, uint32.
	0x18: Unknown, 1 byte. Probably dir type.
	0x19: Padding, 7 bytes.

CD directory
	Same as HDD directory but
	0x19: Unknown, 1 byte. Probably the top byte of the file count.
	0x1A: File count, uint8. Probably actually uint16.
	0x1B: Padding, 5 bytes.

This directory list can probably take up the rest of the first block.
			
On hard drives, I've only ever seen two types of directories: "System Directory"
(0x20) and "Sound Directory " (0x40).
			
On CDs, I've seen three types of directories: "Instrument Group" (0x48),
"map1 Instrument " (0x4A) and "Sound Directory " (0x40).


The one we care about is the sound directory, which contains the file entries
for the areas.

Area file entry
	0x00: Name, 48 chars.
	0x30: Block address, uint32.
	0x34: Block count, uint32.
	0x38: Unknown, 1 byte. Probably file type. 0x41 for area files.
	0x39: Only on CDs; instrument group index, 1 byte.
	0x3A: Padding, 6 bytes.

	Again, each area is an S-550 diskette image; minus the header and OS data.

	On CDs only; immediately after the end of each area, there seems to be some
	sort of footer. This footer is 0x400 bytes long and does not count as part
	of any areas. It seems like this "footer" might actually be a partial area
	file list, with the preceding area as the first entry.
	On L-CD1, these footers only contain the file entry for the preceding area.
	The block adresses in these entries do not line up with their counterparts
	from the sound directory and are incorrect.
	On other CD images I've examined, these footers do contain entries for other
	areas. These entries seem to contain correct block addresses.


Instrument groups are a series 32-char text entries, one after the other. Each
one of these is the name of a group. Areas are assigned to groups throught their
instrument group index (0-based).


Maps are arrays of uint16s. I have no idea how these actually work.


The system directory contains entries similar to those in the sound directory.
However, the name's filled with 0x2D ("-") and either there's no file type byte
or it's 0xFF.

System files looked fairly empty to me, but I did not check thoroughly. I assume
they're supposed to contain the S-550's OS. I don't know why there's 4 of them
on all images I've checked.

Strangely, the last system file seems to overlap with the first area on all HDD
images I have checked. Specifically, the last system file spans 0x500 blocks
starting from block 0x1000; so it would end at the end of block 0x14FF. The
first area is listed as starting at block 0x14F8, which it does. This means that
the last 8 blocks in the last system file are actually the first 8 block of the
first area. I'm not sure if this is intended.
