I got the data structures from the Q-Gears documentation.
Also got some information from Phanoo's webzone:

PS1 is little-endian.

You can inspect the discs' filesystems on a PC like any regular CD-ROM, although
all files are hidden. I think it's regular ISO9660, although I'm not sure how
that interacts with CD-XA.

INSTR.ALL contains a 16-byte header and the rest is mono 4-bit ADPCM audio.
The resulting PCM audio will be 16-bit signed 22.05 (or maybe 22.1?) KHz.

INSTR.DAT contains "patch" data. The patches are really simple, however; they're
barely more than samples. The first two variables are the start of a sample
(absolute address) and the loop start point (also an absolute address). Both
have an offset of +0x1000.
Next is ADSR envelope data; as well as "pitch" data in the form of 12 32-bit
ints per sample, which I'm assuming is some sort of tuning data. I think the
pitch values might represent sample rates, but it's just a wild guess.

The start and loop points use SPU addresses. The sample address space starts at
0x1000. The first 16 bytes are usually occupied by a sine wave. Thus, the game's
sample address space starts at 0x1010. To read straight from INSTR.ALL using
INSTR.DAT's addresses, 0x1000 must be subtracted. This takes into account the
16-byte header in INSTR.ALL, which is why we don't subtract 0x1010.

From St√©phane "Phanoo" Damo's webzone:
	ADPCM provies a 1:1.75 linear compression ratio (16 ADPCM bytes are
	uncompressed to 28 PCM bytes). Therefore all sound offsets and loop points
	must be multiplied by 1.75 if you deal with the uncompressed PCM instead of
	decoding ADPCM on the fly.

Assuming you strip out the header, I think the right way to do it would be:
	org_addr -= 0x1010;
	org_addr -= org_addr / 16 * 2;

You can then optionally multiply by 2 if you want the address or keep it as is
to get the sample index. If using 4-bit ADPCM; you would need to multiply by 2,
optionally 4.

Do sequences define more complex patches?
