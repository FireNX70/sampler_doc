# Sampler doc
Documentation for old sampler formats.

Documentation for E-MU's filesystem and E4 bank format; and the Roland S-50,
S-550 and W-30, and S-7XX formats is fairly complete. These are only missing
variables or data structures which can be safely ignored.

The E-MU EIII bank format is missing documentation for preset linking, which
might affect the overall structure of the data.

The Akai formats were already reverse-engineered and documented by other people
elsewhere. This repository contains my notes (which also point to their
documentation), as well as my pattern files.
