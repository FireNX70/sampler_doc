# Sampler doc
Documentation for old sampler formats.

Documentation for E-MU's filesystem and E4 bank format and the Roland S-50,
S-550 and W-30; and S-7XX formats is fairly complete. These are only missing
variables or data structures which can be safely ignored.

The E-MU EIII bank format is missing documentation for preset linking, which
might affect the overall structure of the data.

The Akai formats were already reverse engineered and documented by other people
elsewhere. I have uploaded my notes, which also point to their documentation. I
have also uploaded some pattern files.
