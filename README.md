# Sampler doc
Documentation for old sampler formats.

The E-MU formats and the Roland S-50, S-550 and W-30 formats are fairly
complete.
The Roland S-7XX diskette format and filesystem are partially documented and
require hardware testing.

The Akai formats were already reverse engineered and documented by other people
elsewhere. I have uploaded my notes, which also point to their documentation. I
have also uploaded some pattern files.
