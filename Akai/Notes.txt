S900 and older
	Their formats don't seem to be nearly as widespread as the S1000/S3000
	format. They had some sort of disk interface, but I don't know if it was
	SCSI. Because these formats weren't all that popular and probably mostly
	used diskettes, which use their own special format and are incompatible with
	PCs; I'm not gonna bother with them.


S1000/S3000
	Documented by Hiroyuki Ohsaki https://lsnl.jp/~ohsaki/software/akaitools/
	S3000-format.html
	and Paul Kellett http://www.maxim.abel.co.uk/akai/akaiinfo.htm (use the
	waybackmachine).

	S1000 and S3000 share the same overall filesystem and have very similar data
	structures. Later S1000 OSes can work with the S3000 FS.

	First partition contains partition table at 0x4500.
	Test patch called "TEST PROGRAM" at 0x5000 within each part (maybe some
	disks only).
	Volume 1 usually starts at 0x6000. No real volume metadata besides type
	(S1000 or S3000) and start block.

	100 volumes per part. Volumes appear to be directories moreso than banks.
	Original file (per volume) limit of 125 (according to ChickenSys) or 128
	(according to Hiroyuki Ohsaki) on the S1000.
	Extended limit of 509 (according to ChickenSys) or 512 (according to
	Hiroyuki Ohsaki) on the S3000. S1000 volumes retain the old limits.

	Mesa uses .PRG, .S3P and .SP files for programs and wav files for samples.
	Acording to Awave, S3P files use "a 'SysEx' like format". After managing to
	get some S3P files, I can confirm it looks like SysEx.
	ChickenSys' Akai format page claims PRG, SP and S3P files are all actually
	the same format with different extensions; with PRG and S3P being used on
	PCs and SP being used on Mac. If that's the case, this means Akai's only
	actual S1000/S3000 file format stores SysEx data.

	While Awave does not seem to be able to export PRG or SP files; it does
	export P and S files, which appear to be raw copies of the on-disk data
	structures corresponding to programs and samples, respectively. This does
	seem like a far more practical approach to storing copies of Akai programs
	and samples on PC. This was apparently also done by Creamware for their
	Pulsar cards.


S5000/S6000
	AKP files for programs and wav files for samples.
	AKP files are RIFF.

	AKP reverse engineered and documented by Seb Francis here:
	https://burnit.co.uk/AKPspec/.
	
	Wav manufacturer specific data documented by Paul Kellett.
	Samples use fact and smpl chunks, which are standardized.

	Unsure about filesystem or on-disk data structures. However, I remember
	reading something about Akai using the "DOS" format (aka probably some
	variant of FAT) on the S5000/S6000.
