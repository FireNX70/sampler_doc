Banks may not point to the same instrument multiple times. Or at least, the
Windows version of SampleCell Editor didn't let me add an instrument which was
already open.

IFF file. FourCC is "MixD".

Chunks are:
	FVER (standard IFF chunk)
	ANNO (standard IFF chunk)
	FILP (common, see FILP doc)
	InsP
	PRNT (NOT standard, AFAIK)
	WinI

FVER seems to always be "Monk" (0x4D6F6E6B).


InsP
	0x00: char[4]. FourCC.
	0x04: uint32. Size.
	0x08: uint32. Entry count.
	0x0C: uint32. Entry size.
	0x10: InsP entries.

	One entry per instrument, corresponding to FILP entries.


InsP entry (0x12, but size technically variable. See InsP.)
	0x00: uint8. Unknown, but likely upper byte for 0x01. Always 0.
	0x01: uint8. Gain. 0 - 99, default 99.
	0x02: int16. Pan. +-99.
	0x04: uint8. Unknown, but likely upper byte for 0x05. Always 0.
	0x05: uint8 (enum). Output. Corresponds to stereo pairs.
	0x06: uint8. Unknown, but likely upper byte for 0x07. Always 0.
	0x07: uint8 (enum). Solo/mute status.
	0x08: uint8. Unknown, but likely upper byte for 0x09. Always 0.
	0x09: uint8. MIDI channel.
	0x0A: uint8. Unknown, but likely upper byte for 0x0B. Always 0.
	0x0B: uint8. Low note (MIDI).
	0x0C: uint8. Unknown, but likely upper byte for 0x0D. Always 0.
	0x0D: uint8. High note (MIDI).
	0x0E: uint8[4]. Unknown, 4 bytes.

	Not sure why everything's interleaved with 0s. I thought it might be for
	either stereo or multi-sample instruments, but that doesn't seem to be the
	case. Maybe it's all 16-bit? Pan turned out to be, since negatives set the
	upper byte to 0xFF.

	Gain is presented as a range of 0 - (-49, -inf), where 99 is displayed as 0
	and 0 is displayed as -inf.

	Solo/Mute: "Mute (Induced)" (value 2) is caused by other channels being
	soloed. It's removed (set to 0) when solo is unmarked. Manual mute takes
	precedence, value will stay 3 even if another channel is soloed.

	Unknown (0x0E) appears to always be 0x00 0x01 0x04 0x98.


Output enum
	one_two = 0,
	three_four,
	five_six,
	seven_eight


Solo/mute enum
	none = 0,
	mute,
	mute_induced,
	solo


PRNT
	No idea what this does. Seems to always be 122 bytes in size (not counting
	IFF chunk data).


WinI
	Probably window data for SampleCell Editor. Not particularly relevant;
	nothing I did changed it, but I didn't try resizing or moving the bank's
	window in SampleCell Editor.
