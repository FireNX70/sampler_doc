The vast majority of my research was conducted on the Windows NT 4.0 version of
SampleCell Editor 2.1.3, with a SampleCell II Plus.

The format is split into three layers: banks, instruments and samples.
Banks reference instruments, instruments reference samples.

Both banks and instruments are IFF files. Chunks are listed in their usual order
of appearance, although it shouldn't matter. Both layers rely on standard IFF
chunks (like "ANNO" chunks), and layer-specific chunks. The only non-standard
chunk used by both layers is the "FILP" chunk, used to reference files
corresponding to the next layer below.
Both banks and instruments are big-endian, even on Windows. Keep in mind;
they're still regular IFF files, not RIFF. Thus, the endianness.
On Mac, the resource fork on both banks and instruments seems to be completely
irrelevant. It was completely empty on all files I checked.
The only major difference between the Mac and Windows formats seems to be in the
structure of the FILP chunk.
Neither layer appears to respect any sort of alignment.


Samples may be any of the following formats:
	Wave
	AIFF (NOT AIFF-C)
	SoundDesigner I
	SoundDesigner II
	MacOS 7 snd resources

I've worked with Wave and AIFF, and SampleCell Editor's manual mentions the
other three. From the SampleCell Editor manual: "[...] you can easily import
samples in the following file types: AIFF, Sound Designer, Sound Designer II, or
Snd [...]". Wave and AIFF are both supported on Windows.
SDII and snd resources are likely only supported on MacOS. They rely on HFS'
resource fork; which means they could theoretically work on NT4 with NTFS' ADS,
and probably on Win98 either with an NTFS driver or using MacBinary. I find this
very unlikely, however.

From SampleCell Editor 3's documentation, it looks like support for WAVs on Mac
was added in that version. Support for 24-bit audio was also added.
Version 3.1 added support for 96KHz and 192KHz files, although the maximum
samplerate for synthesis is still 48KHz.

Samples may use up to 2 loops. From the SampleCell Editor manual: "If a sample
has only 1 loop, it is used as both a sustain and release loop (“sus/rel” in the
Sample Parameters window). When 2 loops exist, the first will be the sustain
loop and the second will be the release loop. Loops must not overlap each
other."
Release loop parameters control the one loop if there's only a single loop.

Considering both features (especially the use of the root note) and
compatibility, AIFF is likely the optimal format for samples for the SampleCell
II.
