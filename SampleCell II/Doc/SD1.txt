SoundDesigner I files. Big-endian.

Documentation by Digidesign themselves here:
	https://www.lim.di.unimi.it/IEEE/DGDES/SDI.HTM

That documentation is for version 32, but the files I have are version 21.
The important stuff appears to line up anyway, so it shouldn't be a problem.

The format is purely mono. Also, it has no provisions for storing a root note.

The relevant parts of the header are:
	0x000: int16. Header size. Should always be 1336 (0x538).
	0x002: int16. Version.
	0x0B8: uint32. Audio size in bytes.
	0x0FE: uint8. Filename length. Max 64.
	0x0FF: char[]. Filename. Not terminated.
	0x2F0: int32. Loop1 start. Byte address, relative to audio.
	0x2F4: int32. Loop1 end. Byte address, relative to audio. One past the end.
	0x3FC: int32. Sample rate.
	0x400: int32. Sample period in microseconds, truncated (22 for 44.1 KHz).
	0x404: int16. Sample size in bits.
	0x406: uint8. Code type length. Max 32.
	0x407: char[]. Code type. Should always be "Linear", I think.
	0x52C: int32. Loop2 start. See loop1 for more info.
	0x530: int32. Loop2 end. See loop1 for more info.
	0x534: 8-bit enum. Loop1 type. 1 = forward, 2 = alternating.
	0x535: 8-bit enum. Loop2 type. See loop1 type for more info.

	Loop addresses are 0xFFFFFFFF (-1) if unused.


Sound data should always immediately follow the header, as far as I know.
